Simple "Monte Carlo" simulation designed to see the anticipated range of outcomes from a portfolio over the number of days present within a typical trading year. 

The number of days within the simulation, as well as the number of simulations completed can both be edited. Security price information (and associated metrics) are acquired through the use of Yahoo stocks.
